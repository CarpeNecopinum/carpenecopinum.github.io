After the success of Fluxus 2.0 at the after-show of "Der Dom Leuchtet" interest in tools that allow audience participation in presentations awakened.

For "RWTH Transparent" in 2019, in addition to the existing "Grafiti" mode that was already used as the event mentioned above, I added a "Scratch Card" mode, as well as a "Survey/Quiz" mode.

In order to allow multiple of these modes to be used in a single event, the intermediate server and mobile web app were adapted to accept mode identifiers that prompt the mobile web app to switch between the different modes of user input.

Besides the additions to the client app, a supervisor app that allows the creation and control of surveys, as well as a second web application that presents the current question and the final results to the audience were implemented.

Each survey can be run in either "secret mode" which only reveals the question with possible answers on the user's smart phone, or in "open mode" in which the current trends in the survey are immediately visible as an animated bar graph.
